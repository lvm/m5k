  * Added load/unload for sound packs
  * Soundpacks!
    This means, if inside the `samples` directory we have a bunch of
    directories each will be a `soundpack`. This way we can load the
    default samplelist + a soundpack with extra sounds.
    ATM it's only possible to load a single soundpack at a time.
